I am swyam kumar gupta from cs background 
i love exploring technological fields from a young age 
i have participated in game dev which had lead me to my achivement in 2021
in which i had won  CII DQ Labs Design Hackathon 2021 under juniors category
at this point i had developed my interest in robotics and after a year of playing around i went into a competition held by sinro  robotics in ernakulam and won the first prize in seniors legos robotics category.
I would present myself as a person who will give their level best to perform well in bios and contribute to the vast number of projects going on.
I believe that i have what it takes to join bios.
