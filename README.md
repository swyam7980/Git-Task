### What to do?

1. Fork and then clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Create a new branch with the your name as the branch name.

4. Add a markdown file to this new branch with your name as the file name and the content should be a brief description of yourself.

5. Now on the same markdown file add the commit hash of the last commit that you made when adding the text file then commit it.

5. Merge the newly created branch with the main branch.

6. Edit this README.md file to add your name at the very end of this file commit it then undo that very action using git reset.

7. Add a new file called 'commands.md' and enter the git commands that you used to each of the steps above.
With a brief description of what each command does and how the git tree changes along with each command. Add this file to the main branch.

That's it you're done!

### Guidelines

- You will be evaluted based on this task during the interview round  so make sure you're that you are doing it on your **own** and not using any AI tools or any assistance out there.

- Make sure to do these steps in order, if you mess up somewhere you can always reset the repository to the initial state and start over.
